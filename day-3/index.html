        <h1>what do i know?</h1>
        <p>
          ain't got a soapbox i can stand upon<br />
          but god gave me a stage, a guitar and a song<br />
          my daddy told me "son, don't you get involved in<br />
          politics, religions or other people's quotes"
        </p>
        <p>
          i'll paint the picture, let me set the scene<br />
          i know when i have children they will know what it means<br />
          and i pass on these things my family's given to me<br />
          just love and understanding, positivity
        </p>
        <p>
          we could change this whole world with a piano<br />
          add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go<br />
          i'm just a boy with a one-man show<br />
          no university, no degree, but lord knows<br />
          everybody's talking 'bout exponential grouwth<br />
          and the stock market crashing in their portfolios<br />
          while i'll be sitting here with a song that i wrote<br />
          sing, love could change the world in a moment<br />
          but what do i know?<br />
